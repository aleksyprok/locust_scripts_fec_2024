This GitHub repository is designed to accompany this repo: https://github.com/aleksyprok/Prokopyszyn_et_al_Nuclear_Fusion_IAEA_2023 and contains the python code and scripts I used for the simulations and figures for the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Authority) FEC (Fusion Energy Conference) 2024 for the alpha losses in STEP.

Most of the code is written in python, however, some of the shell scripts we used to run LOCUST are saved in the shell_scripts directory.
