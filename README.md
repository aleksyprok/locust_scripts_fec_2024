This GitHub repository is designed to accompany this repo: https://github.com/aleksyprok/Prokopyszyn_et_al_Nuclear_Fusion_IAEA_2023 and contains the python code and scripts I used for the simulations and figures for the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Authority) FEC (Fusion Energy Conference) 2024 for the alpha losses in STEP.
